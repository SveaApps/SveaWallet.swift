# Security Policy

### Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, security issues in the SveaWallet can be safely reported as described in the [Developer Portal](https://wallet.svea.com/support/#security-vulnerabilities).  
Svea App Wallet team will triage your report and respond according to its impact on users and systems.
